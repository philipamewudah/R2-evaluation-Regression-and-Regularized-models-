# R2-evaluation-Regression-and-Regularized-models-

In this simple example of predicting a continuous variable, with 3 features, the R^2, coefficient of determination, is used as the methods of evaluation of the models considered. The models are, simple linear regression models of each predictor and the response, multiple linear regression on the entire data and the regularized models, ridge and lasso regressions on the entire data.
